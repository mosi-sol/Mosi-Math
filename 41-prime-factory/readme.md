A concept in the some societies of math exist about the "prime factory". For example the 41 prime spiral factory.\
Formula is: `f = n^2 - n + 41`\
Actually there is some conjectors exist to find primes, not 100% but better than the "41 spiral"

The python code here have 4 charts to show/visualizing this formula.

> first 500 numbers â‰ˆ 40% rejections (non-prime)
