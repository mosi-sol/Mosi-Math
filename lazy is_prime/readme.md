# is prime (lazy solution)

If a number not divided by `2` and `3`, then `((n^2) - 1) % 24 == 0` then that number is prime.

This solution is fastest way to return the Boolean of `is_prime` on programming. In the math problems can to use this solution for find better and fastest than other algorithm.

The longest solution used on programming is `a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p)`. I hate that, I love lazy-solution just for my computer hardware "resources management" :)
