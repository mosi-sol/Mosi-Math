The possible reverse of a number in odd or even with collatz conjecture.

This code reverse the opperations of collatz to find the root of numbers in several odd and even possibilities.

- i changed my base "c" code to this python code

I has observe so many twin numbers made a pattern, like `61`:
```
1952 (even) | 976 (even) | 488 (even) | 244 (even) | 122 (even) | 61 (start)
325 (odd) | 976 (even) | 488 (even) | 244 (even) | 122 (even) | 61 (start)
324 (even) | 162 (even) | 81 (odd) | 244 (even) | 122 (even) | 61 (start)
```
On this observation you can watching `324` and `325` are twins in the root of `61`
